Dataset setting:
*one-channel image*
HWDC--- FMNIIST dataset --- 62 classes ---training set: 11 clients×5 classes ; testing set: 1 new clients×5 classes.
WDI--- WM-811K dataset --- 8 classes ---training set: 3 clients×2 classes ; testing set: 1 new clients×2 classes.
*three-channel image*
EVC --- SurveilEdge  dataset --- 24 classes ---training set: 5 clients×4 classes ; testing set: 1 new clients×4 classes.
TSSR--- Transformer Switches dataset --- 10 classes ---training set: 4 clients×2 classes(open and close) ; testing set: 1 new clients×2 classes(open and close).

Here,  Dataset setting is isolated classes.
For example,   the Dataset setting of WDI scenario is: Random and Scratch classes (client 1); Loc and Center classes (client 2); Edge-Loc and Edge-Ring classes (client 3);  Near-Full and Donut classes (a new client). 

Tip:
Since ecci_sdk.py is an unpublished work, there is no public code here. 
The FLRN work can be done through the MQTT protocol.
